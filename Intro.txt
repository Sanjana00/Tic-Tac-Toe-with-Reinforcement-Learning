Tic Tac Toe: Player vs AI

Training a tic tac toe game with reinforcement learning to improve the AI’s success rate with experience.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. By exploring its environment and exploiting the most rewarding steps, it learns to choose the best action at each stage. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Language: Python and Python modules (pygame etc)

Rules for Tic Tac Toe:

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. 
                                
2. Two people are required to play this game (in this case, a HUMAN and a COMPUTER). You are X, your friend (or the computer) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.                                 
                
3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.                                 
                                
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.                                 


Expected outcome: The AI learns to win the more it plays.
