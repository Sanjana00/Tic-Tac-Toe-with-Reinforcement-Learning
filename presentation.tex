        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions.
            \item<2-> The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment.
            \item<3-> An artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation.
            \item<4-> The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem.
            \item<5-> Its goal is to maximize the total reward.

    \frametitle{Description}
     We are training a tic tac toe game with reinforcement learning to improve the AIâ€™s success rate with experience.
     
     Rules of Tic Tac Toe:
     
     1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.


     2. Two people are required to play this game (in this case, a HUMAN and a COMPUTER). You are X, your friend (or the computer) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.


     3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.


     4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
