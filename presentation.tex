    \frametitle{Technology/Stack/Framework}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Language: Python
            \item Pygame for graphical interface 
            \item ML library yet to be finalised (Tensorflow / Keras / OpenAI etc)
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Description}
    \begin{block}{Reinforcement Learning}        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions.
            \item<2-> The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment.
            \item<3-> An artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation.
            \item<4-> The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem.
            \item<5-> Its goal is to maximize the total reward.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{Status}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Worked on 2 player tic tac toe, modified it to a human vs computer game (where the computer chooses the square randomly)
        \item Reading about Reinforcement Learning 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Temporal Difference
                \item Q learning
                \item Polynomial Gradient
            \end{itemize}
        \item Went through the basics of neural networks
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Learning/Difficulties Faced}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Difficulties faced
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The maths involved in the RL algorithms is difficult to understand
                \item Some of the algorithms are interlinked and it's difficult to make out which is more suitable for which situations
            \end{itemize}
        \item Learning
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Learnt the basics of Regression and neural networks on the go
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
